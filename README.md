# PaikoBoy
Hey! I'm ObscureKagura! The creator of the PaikoBoy. (Yeah, name suggestions are open) This is its Read Me, so let's get started!
# What is a PaikoBoy?
The PaikoBoy is a Portable "console" based on Tiny11 and TJAPlayer3 running on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B onwards.
# Why does the PaikoBoy exist?
Simply put, I really like Taiko no Tatsujin and modding. So, i picked up a Raspberry Pi i already own and got started! There's no exact reason, other than an idiot having fun with videogames and tech.
